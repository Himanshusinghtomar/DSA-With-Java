# DSA-Java-Journey

Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) journey in Java! This repository is a collection of my work as I learn and implement various data structures and algorithms using Java. Whether you're a fellow learner or an experienced developer, I hope you find this repository useful and engaging.

## Introduction

This repository is a part of my personal learning journey to master data structures and algorithms in Java. The goal is to understand the concepts thoroughly and implement them from scratch. Each implementation is accompanied by relevant explanations and example use cases.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, you'll need to have Java installed on your machine. You can download and install Java from the [official website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html).

Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Himanshusinghtomar/DSA-With-Java.git
cd DSA-With-Java
```

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized into the following folders:

- `src/` : Contains the Java source files.
- `tests/` : Contains test cases for the data structures and algorithms.
- `docs/` : Contains documentation and explanatory notes.

## Implemented Data Structures and Algorithms

### Data Structures

- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Trees (Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree, etc.)
- Graphs
- Hash Tables
- Heaps

### Algorithms

- Sorting (Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.)
- Searching (Linear Search, Binary Search)
- Graph Algorithms (DFS, BFS, Dijkstra's Algorithm, etc.)
- Dynamic Programming
- Recursion

## How to Contribute

I welcome contributions to help improve this repository. If you have suggestions, bug reports, or improvements, please create an issue or submit a pull request. When contributing, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature-branch`).
3. Make your changes and commit them (`git commit -m 'Add some feature'`).
